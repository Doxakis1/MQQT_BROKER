# MQT_BROKER
An MQTT broker is a server that enables communication between devices using the MQTT protocol. It acts as a middleman, receiving messages from publishers and distributing them to relevant subscribers. This lightweight protocol is ideal for IoT, and low-bandwidth scenarios, ensuring efficient and real-time data exchange across networks.
